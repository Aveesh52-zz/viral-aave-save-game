# Misc. notes regarding Aave development experience

- Documentation needs to start with "Install SDK" section

- Includes for different .sol files missing in the developer documentation

- Developer documentation lacks anchors for deep links

- It was hard to figure out how to programmatically in Solidy convert DAI to ADAI - example on lendingPool.deposit() needs more meat on the bones

- There is no NPM packages for Aave contracts similar to OpenZeppelin

- Hard to mock up lending pool et. al for the truffle test environment
